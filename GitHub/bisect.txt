Bisect
you can search what commit was good and what commit was base

git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD (the lastest commit)
git bisect good 2482ce1e4a29aa313273e1b8756596bdeb839a2f
git bisect bad #hashIdCommit2
git bisect good #hashIdCommit

so the command bisec will found what commit the changes has done.
