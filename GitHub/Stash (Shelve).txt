when you want to test something but you don't want to commit.
you can make a stash (is bit similar a shelve in TSF) you saved
your changes for continue in another moment.

git stash

to see what are into the stash you use the commit
git stash list

to contiune
git stash pop : I will get the all last change
git stash apply home.html : I will get the specific file.

to delete
you can use the command 
git stash drop 

the command above exclude the stash from git stash.
