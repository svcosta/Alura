git checkout -b newBranch

if you changed a file so you regrest and you want to undo,
you can type the command so go back the code:

git checkout file.html

with this command you are able to undo the changes.

but if you exectued the commed add?

in this case the checkout won't work because you has added. the file is index status.

how do I do so?
you have to change the status of the file

git reset HEAD home.html


if you has commited?
git reset idHashCommit
the files will have the status changed

reverse
you can changes things that has been done.
git revert idHashcommit

git reset --hard HEAD~1 
Usando esse comando, descartamos definitivamente as mudanças feitas no último commit.
